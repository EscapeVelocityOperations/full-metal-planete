Each player is limitedto 3 minutes per turn, and will also be restricted by the number ofaction-points available. Possible actions will include:</P><UL><LI>Mining minerals and transporting them into your Astronef<LI>Using minerals to build more equipment<LI>Attacking opponents with combat equipment<LI>Hindering opponents' movement by occupying areas<LI>Capturing an opponent's Astronef<LI>Negotiating diplomatic agreements</UL><H2>The Planet</H2><P>The area of Full Metal Planet shown on the gameboard has 851 hexagons,half hexes along the long edge do not count. The dotted lines delimitlanding zones for the Astronefs. The sea is blue, the land is ochre,marshes are ochre dotted with blue, mountains are grey and reefs areblue with ochre islands.</P><H2>Minerals</H2><P>The mineral pieces are scattered across the gameboard, one piece every 3hexes. Minerals can be embarked on the Astronef for points, or turnedinto equipment by the Converter. A mineral piece occupies a hex and istherefore an obstacle to movement. At low tide,.minerals can be pickedup anywhere. At normal tide minerals are impossible to reach on reefs.At high tide minerals are impossible to reach on reefs and marshes.</P><H2>Tides</H2><P>Each turn of the game incurs a tide. The 15 Tide cards contain 5 of eachtide type, Low, Normal and High. Tides effect certain terrain types:</P><UL><LI>Low Tide means marshes and reefs are treated as land.<LI>Normal Tide means marshes are land and reefs are sea.<LI>High Tide means marshes and reefs are treated as sea.</UL><H2>Effect of Tides</H2><CENTER><TABLE BORDER><TR><TH> </TH><TH COLSPAN=2>REEFS</TH><TH COLSPAN=2>MARSHES</TH></TR><TR><TH> </TH><TH>Sea Craft</TH><TH>Land Craft</TH><TH>Sea Craft</TH><TH>Land Craft</TH></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Low Tide</TH><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Grounded</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>May Move</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Grounded</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>May Move</TD></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Normal Tide</TH><TD ALIGN=CENTER>May Move</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Stuck</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Grounded</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>May Move</TD></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>High Tide</TH><TD ALIGN=CENTER>May Move</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Stuck</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>May Move</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Stuck</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Pieces caught out of their element are neutralised and may do nothinguntil the tide becomes favourable again. It is possible to voluntarilyneutralise a piece, it becoming stuck/grounded on the first impassablehex it enters.</P><H2>Action Points</H2><P>Each turn a player starts with a base credit of fifteen action- points.These are spent in moving, combat and other activities. It is possibleto increase available action points by either saving up action-pointsfrom a previous turn or capturing another Astronef. If a player onlyspends 10 action-points on a turn, 5 are saved and a cube is taken toshow that the extra five are available for a subsequent turn. If aplayer subsequently only spends 10 on a turn, or else spends only 5 onone turn, two cubes are taken to show 10 reserve action-points. A playermay only ever have a maximum of 10 points in reserve.</P><P>Each captured Astronef adds 5 points to the base credit of the capturingplayer. Thus a player who has captured 2 enemy Astronefs, and saved themaximum action-points from previous. turns, would have 15+5+5+10=35action-points available.</P> <H2>Spending Action Points</H2><CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="2"><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Movement</TH>	<TD>	each hex moved by a piece costs 1 point	</TD></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Loading</TH>	<TD>	each mineral or equipment piece loaded onto a transporter costs 1 point.	</TD></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Unloading</TH>	<TD>	each piece unloaded costs 1 point	</TD></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Building</TH>	<TD>	each piece created by the Converter costs 1 point	</TD></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Enter or Exiting</TH>	<TD>	each piece entering or exiting the Astronef costs Astronef 1 point.<br>Note that the Barge exits for 1 point but immediately occupies 2 hexes.	</TD></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Combat</TH>	<TD>	To destroy an enemy piece costs 2 points (2 shots)	</TD></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Rebuild</TH>	<TD>	To rebuild a tower (only on a captured Astronef) a Tower costs 2 points.	</TD></TR><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Take Off</TH>	<TD>	It costs 1-4 points for an Astronef to take off, depending on its condition.	</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><H3>Note</H3><P>Each action or move is definitive, and may not be revoked.Impossibleactions are only revoked as far as the last legal action/move. Piecesexiting the Astronef occupy a space. Two or more pieces may not occupythe same space (exception - if one piece is transporting the others.</P><H2>Time</H2><P>Each player has 3 minutes to complete his turn. This should be timed byanother player who will call out elapsed time at suitable moments. Theplayer's turn ends after this time, pieces in the process of moving stopon their current hex. This timing is an important aspect of Full MetalPlanet, putting pressure on the players and adding spice.</P><H2>Transporters</H2><P>There are two sorts of transporter pieces; the Barge which has 4 spacesand the Crab which has 2 spaces. Things which can be carried are:Minerals, Tanks, Supertanks, Bridges which each take up one space andConvertors, Crabs which each take up two spaces.</P><UL><LI>Only the Barge may carry a Convertor or Crab.<LI>Pick up is made by moving the cargo from an adjacent hex.<LI>Unloading is made from the transporter to an adjacent hex.<LI>Pick up and unloading each cost an action point per item, except inside the Astronef.<LI>Entering or leaving an Astronef, even if loaded, costs but one action point.<LI>Picking up/unloading a Crab only costs one point, even if the Crab itself is carrying cargo. Cargo could be rearranged between a Crab and Barge while the Barge is carrying the Crab<LI>This costs time but not action points.<LI>A delivery hex must be vacant, or solely occupied by a Bridge, orcontain a Transporter with spare space.<LI>A Transporter may neither load nor unload under enemy fire.<LI>Nothing may be unloaded onto a sea hex.<LI>Items may be unloaded onto reefs/marshes even in unfavourable<LI>tides. Items unloaded will remain stuck until the tide changes.<LI>Items stuck by tides (except Bridges) may not be picked up.</UL><H2>The Convertor</H2><P>The Convertor is unique in that it may build new equipment from mineralpieces. This is done by picking up a mineral, converting the mineralinto equipment, unloading the equipment. This would cost 2 actionpoints, 1 to pick up the mineral and 1 to unload the equipment. AConvertor does not have to create the equipment immediately. It couldpick up the mineral, move, and create the new equipment on another turn.The Convertor may create two new pieces per turn. It may not build twoCrabs or Bridges per turn. When not building new equipment, theConvertor acts very much like a Crab.</P><H2>Tide Prediction</H2><P>When tides change at the beginning of each turn, players possessing aConvertor may look at the next tide card. The Convertors provide theirowners with a prediction of the future tide. Should a player havecaptured another Convertor, he may look at the next two tide cards.Convertors which have been lost, or are in the Astronef, on a Barge,under enemy fire, or stuck by tides, may not predict future tides.</P><H2>Bridges</H2><P>Bridges are inert pieces of equipment which serve to bridge water hexesor render secure reef/marsh hexes. A Bridge is laid or picked up by atransporter, regardless of the tide in the hex. A Bridge makes the hex aland hex and prevents Barges and Motor Boats using it. A Bridge mustconnect to a land hex or to another bridge hex. A Bridge may be neitherlaid or picked up under enemy fire. Should a connecting Bridge hex bedestroyed, or the connecting land hex be submerged by tides, the rest ofthe Bridge is destroyed. When a Bridge is destroyed, all pieces standingon the bridge are likewise destroyed. A Bridge is neutral. Once laid itcan be used by any vehicle. A Bridge laid by one player could be pickedup by another!</P><H2>Combat Vehicles</H2><P>The Combat vehicles can destroy any piece, mineral or vehicle, exceptthe Astronef and its contents. There are four combat units; Tanks, SuperTanks, Motor Boats and Astronef Towers.</P><H2>Combat</H2><P>There is one rule of combat : any piece which falls under thesimultaneous fire of two combat vehicles of an enemy player is removedfrom the game. It costs one action point for each of the two shots.Combat consists of moving two vehicles into position and then firing onthe target. Astronef Tower, Tank and Motor Boat have a range of twohexes. The Super Tank can hit targets up to 3 hexes away. A normal Tankin position on.a mountain hex can shoot 3 hexes, even to anothermountain hex. The Super Tank may never enter a mountain hex, even iftransported. Between two turns, two Tanks may not move onto two adjacentmountain hexes.</P><P>Combat vehicles may shoot over any obstacle, including minerals, othervehicles, mountains. A Combat Vehicles may shoot only twice per playerturn, but other actions may come between shots.</P><P>A Combat Vehicle may not shoot at his own pieces. When two CombatVehicles shoot at a hex, all pieces in that hex are destroyed.</P><P>Between turns it can be advantageous to have hexes &quot;underfire&quot; in order to interdict enemy actions. A hex is under fire whenit is within range of two or more Combat Vehicles of the same player.</P><P>A piece may never move into a hex under fire except when it is thesecond Combat Vehicle moving into position to shoot and eliminate theenemy so that it is no longer under fire. A piece may never be unloadedfrom a transporter into a hex under fire.</P><H2>Capture</H2><P>Two Combat Vehicles may capture an enemy by moving adjacent to thatenemy vehicle. Capture costs one action point. The piece immediatelychanges colour and can be used by its new owner. Capture can only takeplace if all vehicles are free from enemy fire; thus vulnerable piecescan be protected from capture by placing them under fire. The contentsof a Transporter are captured with it. Combat Vehicles may still captureunits even if they have fired twice that turn.</P><H2>Retreat &amp; Neutralisation</H2><P>It is possible for units to come under fire without the player botheringto use action points to destroy them. In this case, the menaced playermay retreat such pieces one hex at the beginning of his turn to escapethe fire. A piece incapable of this is neutralised, and may do nothingelse the rest of its turn. It can only escape if other Combat Vehiclescome to its rescue. It is not possible to neutralise an Astronef Tower.Even under fire, the Tower may shoot back.</P><H2>The Astronef</H2><P>The Astronef consists of a central body and three podes. It occupiesfour hexes. Apart from its turrets, an Astronef and its cargo areindestructible. Everything in the Astronef should be placed in front ofthe player, visible to all. The Astronef may occupy only plain and marshhexes, and it does not suffer from tides.</P><P>Vehicles enter and leave the Astronef by its podes. To enter or leavethe Astronef costs one action point, even for the Barge. Once mineralhas been taken into the Astronef, it may not be converted or taken outagain. It costs nothing to load/unload transporters inside the Astronef,except time.</P><P>A vehicle can enter/leave a pode under enemy fire, as long as theoutside hex used is not under fire. It is not possible to leave by apode whose turret has been destroyed. It is possible to enter via such apode.</P><P>When an Astronef's three turrets have been destroyed, it becomesvulnerable to capture. The first player to enter the Astronef with ahostile Combat Vehicle captures it and all that player's pieces. When anastronef is captured, that player gains an extra 5 action points perturn. All the pieces retain their original colour, that player then hasa mixed force. This is so that if one of his Astronefs is captured, itis possible to tell which pieces belong to which Astronef. Only a playerwho captures/recaptures an Astronef may rebuild the turrets. Each turretcosts 2 action points to rebuild. Turrets may not be rebuilt if underenemy fire.</P><P>It should be noted that even when the three turrets are destroyed, theAstronef remains the property of its original player until captured. Thecapture of an Astronef is the only time an enemy piece may penetrate anAstronef. A piece may enter to capture an Astronef via a turret underfire.</P><H2>Starting a Game</H2><P>Place the minerals out across the board on plain/marsh/reef hexes,spacing them every three hexes. Each player takes an Astronef, a set ofcoloured markers, and a force pool of 1 Barge, 1 Crab, 1 Convertor, 2Motor Boats, 4 Tanks, 1 Super Tank and 1 Bridge. The remaining pieces ofequipment are placed to one side, available to players who build withtheir Convertor. Shuffle the 15 Tide cards, place nine in the&quot;Future Tides&quot; tray and discard the remaining six.</P><H3>Turn 1</H3><P>Place the Turn marker on Turn 1, and decide the order of play. Eachplayer in turn has three minutes to decide on a landing zone and placehis Astronef on Full Metal Planet. Astronefs may land on the islands, orstraddling the border of two zones. An Astronef may not land in a zoneadjacent to one already occupied (islands are not adjacent to any zone).An Astronef occupies four hexes, which must be plain or marsh. TheAstronef must have means to exit its pieces!</P><H3>Turn 2</H3><P>Turn marker advances one space. All players together then have 3 minutesto deploy all or some of their forces from their Astronef, into theirarrival zone. Boats may only move onto adjacent sea hexes touching thecoast. Transporters may be deployed carrying equipment. The Tide isconsidered normal this turn.</P><H3>Turn 3</H3><P>Randomly chose a first player for the game, turns passing clockwise.Turn over the first Tide card and place it in the Current Tide tray.Players with a Convertor operational may look at the next hidden Tidecard. Players in turn have 3 minutes and 5 action points to utilise.</P><H3>Turn 4</H3><P>As for Turn 3 except players now have 10 action points.</P><H3>Turn 5+</H3><P>As for Turns 3 &amp; 4 except players now have 15 action points from nowon.</P><P>When the Tide cards run out, add in the discarded ones, shuffle, andselect a new batch of nine.</P><H3>Turn 21</H3><P>Each player secretly writes down whether his Astronef will lift off thisturn or remain on Full Metal Planet until Turn 25. Those taking offleave immediately with the contents of their Astronef. A player withseveral Astronefs may lift of with some, but loses the extra actionpoints for each one.</P><H3>Turn 25</H3><P>Remaining Astronefs lift off, paying one action point to take off plusan extra point for each destroyed turret. If this proves impossible, theAstronef stays stranded on Full metal Planet to the end of time!</P><H2>Scoring</H2><P>Each mineral point removed from Full Metal Planet is worth 2 points,each piece of equipment 1 point, each turret intact 1 point.</P><P><A HREF="../">The Game Cabinet</A> -  <A HREF="mailto:editor@gamecabinet.com">editor@gamecabinet.com</A>- <A HREF="../biography/KenTidwell.html">Ken Tidwell</A></P><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">_uacct = "UA-1707666-1";urchinTracker();</script></body></HTML>
